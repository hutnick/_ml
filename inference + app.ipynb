Voilà is taking advantage of the fact that a notebook _already is_ a kind of web application, just a rather complex one that depends on another web application: Jupyter itself. Essentially, it helps us automatically convert the complex web application which we've already implicitly made (the notebook) into a simpler, easier-to-deploy web application, which functions like a normal web application rather than like a notebook.\n",
